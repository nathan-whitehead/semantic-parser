  "explanation": "Explanation\n=====================================\n\nThe error message indicates that the code is trying to multiply a sequence (a tuple) with a non-integer value (another tuple), which is not allowed in Python. The problem lies in the line where we're using `zip(t1, t2)` to iterate over the tuples and then multiplying them together. We should instead unpack the individual elements from the tuples before performing multiplication.\n\nCode\n=====",
