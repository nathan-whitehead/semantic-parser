  "explanation": "Explanation\n----------\n\nThe provided code attempts to convert a decimal number to binary. However, the issue lies in how it handles the case when the input is negative. The function correctly calculates the absolute value of the input and then appends the negative sign if necessary. Nevertheless, this approach will not produce the expected output for negative numbers because of how binary representation works.\n\nThe problem also arises from the order of operations in the while loop. Currently, the remainder (n % 2) is appended to the binary string before updating n with its integer division by 2. This results in incorrect binary representations.\n\nCode\n-----",
