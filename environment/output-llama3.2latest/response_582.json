  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function checks if a dictionary is empty by verifying its size using the `len()` function. It then returns a boolean value indicating whether the dictionary is empty (i.e., has no keys) or not. This approach is simple and efficient, making it suitable for most use cases.\n\n**python**",
