  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe code is attempting to calculate the nth Pell number using a recursive approach with base cases for n = 1 and n = 2. However, this approach does not accurately represent the mathematical formula for Pell numbers, which involves iterative calculations.\n\nCode\n-----",
