  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe original code attempts to count the number of integral co-ordinates inside a square by iterating over all possible x and y values within the square. However, this approach is inefficient as it considers every single point in the square, not just those that actually lie within it. A better approach would be to calculate the total area of the square and then subtract any points on the edges or outside the square from this total.\n\n# python",
