  "explanation": "Explanation\n==========\n\nThe original code has several issues. It does not handle the case when a closing bracket is encountered before an opening bracket, and it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of swaps required for each sequence.\n\nThe corrected code uses a different approach to solve the problem. Instead of iterating over the string twice, it uses two pointers to track the positions of the first and last closing brackets that can be reached with a certain number of swaps.\n\nCode\n----",
