  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided Python function checks if a given list of numbers is increasing or not. It uses a for loop to compare each number with its next one, checking if they are in increasing order. If it finds any pair that doesn't meet this condition, it immediately returns False; otherwise, it iterates over the entire sequence and returns True.\n\n\n**python**",
