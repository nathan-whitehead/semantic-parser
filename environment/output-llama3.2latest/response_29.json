  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe provided code has a logical error in the return statement. The current implementation returns all elements with an odd count, not just those that occur an odd number of times.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the return statement to check if the count is equal to 1 (i.e., occurring an odd number of times). We also need to update the function signature to accept both `arr` and a threshold value.\n\nCode\n-----",
