  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe code attempts to calculate the cumulative sum of unique values present in a tuple list. However, it has an incorrect approach where it sums up all unique values found so far, excluding duplicates, which leads to incorrect results. The issue arises from the fact that `unique_values` is updated inside the loop before calculating the cumulative sum. \n\n**python**",
