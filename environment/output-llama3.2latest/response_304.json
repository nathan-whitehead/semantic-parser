  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe issue with the provided code is that it does not account for all possible combinations of rotations and target indices. When calculating the effective rotation, we need to consider that `rotations` can be greater than `n`. However, when using binary search, the code only checks for potential matches in one half of the array at a time, without considering the case where the target index is in the other half.\n\nCode\n----",
