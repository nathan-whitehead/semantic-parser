  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe provided code attempts to sort a mixed list of integers and strings using the built-in `sort()` function with a custom sorting key. However, this approach fails because it tries to compare an integer with a string directly, which is not allowed in Python. To fix this issue, we need to adjust the sorting key to ensure that both integers and strings are compared correctly.\n\nCode\n-----",
