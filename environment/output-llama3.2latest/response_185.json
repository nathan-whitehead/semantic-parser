  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe code provided has an issue with the calculation of the focal length `x`. The formula is incorrect; it should be `-b / (2 * math.sqrt(a))` instead of `-b / (2 * math.sqrt(abs(a)))`, which would always yield a positive value. This change will ensure that the function produces accurate results.\n\nCode\n----",
