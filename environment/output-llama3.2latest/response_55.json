  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided code is almost correct but has a bug. The issue lies in the calculation of the nth term of the geometric series. The formula used is `a * r ** (n - 1)`, which will not work when n = 1 because it will divide by zero when calculating `(n - 1)`.\n\n**python**",
