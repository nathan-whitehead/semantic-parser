  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe code is attempting to solve the problem by generating triangular numbers and checking if they are present in the input list. However, there's an issue with the function signature where it expects a variable number of arguments but is only accepting one. Additionally, the function name and docstring should match the expected test case structure.\n\n**python**",
