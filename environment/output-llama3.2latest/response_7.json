  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function uses Python's built-in `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions. The approach is to use a regular expression pattern that matches any sequence of characters that are four or more characters long. The pattern is then applied to the input string, and the matched words are returned.\n\n**Python**",
