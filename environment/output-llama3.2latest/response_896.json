  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code attempts to sort a list of tuples based on their last element. However, the function definition is incorrect as it tries to use the `python` keyword as a variable name, which raises a `NameError`. To fix this, we need to define a valid function that extracts and compares the last elements of each tuple.\n\nCode\n-----",
