  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe original code attempts to solve the problem by combining all three arrays into one list while maintaining their relative order. It then iterates over this combined list, finding the smallest element among the current pointers and storing its closest elements from each array in a result list. However, the main issue is that it tries to find the minimum of a list containing floats with a single lambda function that takes two arguments, but Python's built-in `min` function doesn't support this syntax.\n\n**python**",
