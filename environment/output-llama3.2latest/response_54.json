  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided Python function implements the counting sort algorithm to sort an array. The approach used is to first count the occurrences of each unique element in the array and then construct a new sorted array based on these counts. This method is suitable for sorting arrays with small ranges of integers or characters.\n\n**python**",
