  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. We will use bitwise operations to calculate the Hamming distance between two integers.\nWe will iterate over each bit position in the binary representation of the integers and count the number of positions where the bits are different.\n\n**python**",
