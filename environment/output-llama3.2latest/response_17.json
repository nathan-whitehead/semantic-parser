  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe function will calculate the perimeter of a square by multiplying the length of its side by 4. It uses the concept that all sides of a square are equal and therefore, its perimeter can be calculated easily. This function assumes that the input is valid (i.e., a number) and does not include any error checking.\n\n**PYTHON**",
