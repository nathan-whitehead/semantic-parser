  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to check if the input string ends with only alphanumeric characters using regex. However, it has a logical error in its approach. The `re.search()` function is used to search for non-alphanumeric characters from the start of the string to the end, which is the opposite of what's needed. To fix this, we need to use `re.search()` with a pattern that matches only from the end of the string.\n\n**python**",
