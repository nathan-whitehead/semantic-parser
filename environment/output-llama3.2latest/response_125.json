  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe current implementation of the function is incorrect. It does not correctly calculate the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string. The issue lies in the fact that it returns the minimum difference when the absolute value of the current difference exceeds the allowed maximum difference, which is not correct. \n\nThe corrected code first initializes counters for the total count of 0s and 1s, and then iterates over the string updating these counts based on whether the current character is '0' or '1'. It also keeps track of the current difference between the two counts. When the maximum allowed difference is exceeded, it resets the counters and calculates the new maximum difference.\n\nCode\n-----",
