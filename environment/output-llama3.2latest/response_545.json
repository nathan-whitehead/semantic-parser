  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe generated code attempts to toggle only the first and last bits of a given number. However, it incorrectly applies the mask to the entire binary representation instead of just the specific positions. Additionally, the `bit_length` calculation is not needed as we can directly use the length of the binary string.\n\nCode",
