  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code is attempting to use a two-dimensional array (`buy` and `sell`) to store the minimum price that can be bought at each point in time and the maximum profit after selling at each point in time, respectively. However, this approach leads to an error when trying to concatenate a list with an integer using the `*` operator. A more suitable approach is to use a single array (`buy`) to store the minimum price that can be bought at each point in time and update it accordingly.\n\n**python**",
