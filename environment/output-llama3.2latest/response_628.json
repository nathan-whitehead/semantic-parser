  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThis function uses a simple substitution approach to replace all spaces in the input string with the specified sequence of characters. It iterates over each character in the string, and if it encounters a space, replaces it with the specified sequence. The result is then returned as a new string.\n\n**PYTHON**",
