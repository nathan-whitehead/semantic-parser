  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list with all digits removed. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the input list, and for each string, it uses another list comprehension to create a new list that only includes characters that are not digits. This approach ensures that the original input is not modified.\n\n**python**",
