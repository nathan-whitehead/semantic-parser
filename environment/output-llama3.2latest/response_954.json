  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe given code attempts to calculate the profit amount by multiplying the given amount with the rate. However, it does not correctly apply the formula for calculating profit which is: Profit = (Amount * Rate)/100 + Amount. The main issue lies in the calculation part where only Amount*Rate/100 was being calculated leaving out Addition of Amount from the equation. Also, 10% was taken as the default rate.\n\n**python**",
