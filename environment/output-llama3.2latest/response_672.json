  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function takes three numbers as input and returns the maximum value among them. The approach is straightforward, comparing each number with every other number and updating the maximum if necessary. This function uses Python's built-in comparison operators and does not require any external libraries.\n\n**python**",
