  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code had several issues: it imported the math module twice, used an unnecessary import statement for the slant height calculation, and did not properly calculate the total surface area. The corrected version of the function calculates the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem correctly and then multiplies it by half to get the area of one triangular side. It adds this value to the square base area multiplied by 4 to get the total surface area.\n\nPython",
