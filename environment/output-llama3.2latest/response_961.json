  "explanation": "Explanation\n==========\n\nThe original code attempts to convert a Roman numeral to an integer by iterating over the input string and checking if each numeral appears again later. If it does, its value is subtracted from the result; otherwise, its value is added.\n\nHowever, this approach has issues, as indicated by the error message. The problem lies in how the code handles repeated numerals. When a smaller numeral appears after a larger one, the code should actually add the difference between their values to the result, not subtract it.\n\nCode\n=====",
