  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe provided code has a logical error. It tries to use the `python` keyword as a function name, which raises a NameError because `python` is a built-in Python keyword and cannot be used as a variable or function name. Additionally, there seems to be an incorrect loop direction in the for loop. The code should start from `n-1` down to 0 instead of going up to `n-2`. Also, there's an incorrect update operation inside the loop; it should be `a, b = a, b + (b * (a - 1))`.\n\nCode\n-----",
