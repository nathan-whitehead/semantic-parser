  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe original code attempts to count the repeated items in a tuple by iterating over each item, converting it to a set for efficient lookups, and then calculating its length. However, the issue lies in how the function is defined - it currently expects an argument, but within the function definition itself, no arguments are specified. The error message indicates that the function is being called with two positional arguments (the tuple and the expected output), which causes the TypeError because the function does not accept any arguments.\n\nTo correct this issue, we need to restructure the code so it takes one argument, which will be passed as a keyword-argument `input_list` instead of a positional argument. Additionally, since the `map()` function returns an iterator, we'll use a list comprehension to convert its output into a list for easier iteration.\n\n**PYTHON**",
