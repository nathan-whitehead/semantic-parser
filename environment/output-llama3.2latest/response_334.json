  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function checks if a triangle can be formed with the given side lengths. A triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. The function uses this rule to determine if the triangle is valid or not.\n\n**python**",
