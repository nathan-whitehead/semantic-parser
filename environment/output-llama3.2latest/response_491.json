  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe provided code attempts to calculate the sum of a geometric progression series. However, it contains an issue with variable naming and indentation. The function also has different conditions for calculating the sum based on the common ratio (r) being equal or not equal to 1.\n\nCode\n-----",
