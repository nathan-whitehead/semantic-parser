  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to square each element in the list using a lambda function within a list comprehension. However, this approach results in a nested list of lambdas, which is not what we want. Additionally, the code imports numpy but does not use it. We need to rewrite the code to produce a new list with squared elements without any unnecessary modules or complex data structures.\n\n**Python**",
