  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code has several issues. It is not correctly multiplying consecutive numbers in the list because it stops updating the `current_product` after appending it to the `products` list. Also, it does not handle consecutive duplicates properly.\n\nCode\n----",
