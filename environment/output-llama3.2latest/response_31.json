  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided problem is asking us to create a function named `candidate` that takes in several lists of sorted and distinct integers, and returns the top k integers that occur most frequently. We can use a heap queue algorithm (also known as a priority queue) to efficiently find these frequent integers.\n\nWe will first count the frequency of each integer by iterating through all the lists, then we'll sort the frequencies in descending order using the `heapq` module in Python's standard library. Finally, we'll return the top k frequent integers from the sorted list.\n\n**python**",
