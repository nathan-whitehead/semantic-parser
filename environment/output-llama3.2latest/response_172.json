  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code provided does not meet the required specifications as it uses a function called `find_std_occurrences` instead of `candidate`. The test cases also rely on the function being named `candidate`.\n\nTo correct this, we need to rename the function from `find_std_occurrences` to `candidate` and add an indented block inside the function where our code will be placed. \n\n**python**",
