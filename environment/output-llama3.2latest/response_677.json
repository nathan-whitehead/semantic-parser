  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe code provided checks if a triangle with sides of lengths `a`, `b`, and `c` is valid. It implements the Triangle Inequality Theorem to verify this. However, the issue lies in the fact that once it finds an invalid condition, it immediately returns `False`. This causes issues when one of the conditions is met while others are not.\n\n**python**",
