  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe current implementation has several issues. It only returns the first most frequent element if there are multiple elements with the same maximum frequency, but it does not handle cases where there is a tie for the maximum frequency correctly.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to return all elements that have the maximum frequency instead of just one. Additionally, we need to modify the function to correctly handle ties by returning all most frequent elements.\n\n\nPython",
