  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code was attempting to shift the last element of a list to the first position. However, the function was named `shift_last_to_first` but there was no corresponding `candidate` function defined anywhere in the script. The `candidate` function was needed to make the test pass.\n\nCode\n-----",
