  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code has multiple issues. The loop for generating substrings is incorrect because it only checks substrings up to the length of the string, not all possible combinations. Additionally, the condition in the if statement is checking for equality with `target_sum` which is not needed and would cause an incorrect result.\n\n**python**",
