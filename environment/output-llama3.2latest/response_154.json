  "explanation": "Explanation\n================\nThe given code attempts to extract specified elements from a two-dimensional list. However, it has several issues, including incorrect logic for extracting the elements and not handling duplicate occurrences properly.\n\nHere's why:\n- The current implementation is checking if any element in the matrix matches the inputted element (`element`), which would always return true because `any()` will return as soon as it finds a match.\n- It then uses another nested loop to extract all sub-elements that match the given element, even though we're only supposed to find one occurrence of each specified element.\n\nCode\n================",
