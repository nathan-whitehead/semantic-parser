  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function checks if the input list contains consecutive numbers. It iterates over the list, comparing each number with its index plus one (since indices start at 0). If it finds any pair of numbers that do not have a difference of 1, it immediately returns False; otherwise, it returns True.\n\n**python**",
