  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe given code is attempting to solve the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = n` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. However, there are several issues with the code that prevent it from working correctly.\n\nThe main issue is with the line where we calculate `k`. The formula `k = (n * y - b * x) // gcd` should be `k = (n * y - b * x) % gcd`. This is because we need to find a value of `k` such that `ax + by = k*gcd`, which means `k` must be the remainder when `n` is divided by `gcd`.\n\nAdditionally, when calculating `x_solution`, the line `x_solution = ((k % b) * x) % b` should be `x_solution = (k * x) % b`. This is because we need to find the value of `x` that satisfies `ax + by = k*gcd`, which means `x` must be the remainder when `k*x` is divided by `b`.\n\nFinally, there are some formatting issues with the function names and variable names. The variables `solution_x` and `solution_y` could be renamed to something more descriptive, such as `x_solution` and `y_solution`.\n\nCode",
