  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code was attempting to calculate the sum of a sequence that starts from n and decreases by 2 until it reaches 0. However, this approach only considers every other integer in the sequence, not all positive integers up to n-2.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the function to generate the correct sequence. The given formula was close but incorrect.\n\nCode\n----",
