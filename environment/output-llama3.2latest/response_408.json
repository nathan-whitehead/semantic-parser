  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\nThe code provided does not correctly implement the function to find k number of pairs which consist of one element from the first array and one element from the second array. The current implementation tries to form a pair with any other element from arr2 that can be added to num, but this approach is incorrect as it doesn't consider the fact that we want to find all possible pairs.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to iterate through arr1 and for each number, find all numbers in arr2 that when paired with it sum up to k. We will then return these pairs.",
