  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe original code has a logic error. It tries to calculate the absolute differences between consecutive elements of the sequence, but it fails when the sequence contains characters instead of integers. We need to add input validation to ensure that only sequences of numbers are processed.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can modify the function to check if all elements in the sequence are numbers before attempting to calculate their differences.\n\n**python**",
