  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe problem is asking for a Python function that calculates the sum of all elements in a given array. The approach will involve using a simple loop to iterate through each element in the array and adding it to a running total, which will be stored in a variable. This will result in an efficient function with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.\n\n**python**",
