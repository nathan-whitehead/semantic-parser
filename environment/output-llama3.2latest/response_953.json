  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code has a logical error where it's trying to calculate the minimum number of subsets with distinct elements for each subset size. However, this approach is incorrect as it doesn't consider all possible combinations of subsets.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to use bit manipulation techniques to generate all possible subsets and then count the number of subsets with distinct elements.\n\n**python**",
