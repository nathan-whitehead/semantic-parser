  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe code provided attempts to check if a given number is a perfect cube or not by calculating its cube root and comparing it with the original number. However, this approach has several issues, including incorrect handling of negative numbers and floating-point precision errors. The correct solution involves checking all possible cube roots within a reasonable range.\n\n**python**",
