  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code has several issues. The `tuples` parameter should be passed to the function as a list of tuples instead of just being a variable inside the function. Also, the condition in the if statement where we check for duplicates needs to return a boolean value instead of modifying an external dictionary.\n\nCode",
