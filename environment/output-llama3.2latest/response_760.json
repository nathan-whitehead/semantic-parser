  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided Python function checks if an input list has only one distinct element. It does this by converting the list into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. If the lengths of the original list and the set are equal, it means that all elements in the list were unique.\n\n**python**",
