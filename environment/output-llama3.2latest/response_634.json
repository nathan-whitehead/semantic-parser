  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function calculates the sum of the fourth power of the first n even natural numbers. It uses a for loop to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 to 2n, calculates their fourth power using the exponentiation operator (**), and adds it to the total sum.\n\n**python**",
