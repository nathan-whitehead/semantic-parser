  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided problem requires writing a Python function that takes a list as input and returns the count of even numbers present in it. The solution utilizes lambda functions, which are small anonymous functions that can be defined inline within a larger expression. This approach is concise and efficient for solving such problems.\n\n**python**",
