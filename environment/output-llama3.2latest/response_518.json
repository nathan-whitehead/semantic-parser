  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe original code attempts to find the square roots of perfect numbers less than or equal to a given number. However, it contains several issues that prevent it from passing all test cases. First, the condition for checking if a number is perfect is incorrect. A perfect number is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). Second, the code checks if the square root of a perfect number exists by comparing it with the given input `n`, which is not correct. Finally, the function returns a set of unique square roots instead of checking if each number in the set is indeed a square root.\n\n# python",
