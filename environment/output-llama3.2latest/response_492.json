  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code provided is attempting to implement a binary search algorithm. However, it contains a flaw in the base case of the recursion where it doesn't properly handle when the target element is not found in the array. The function should return `False` instead of `-1` because the problem statement asks for an element to be searched in the given array.\n\nCode\n----",
