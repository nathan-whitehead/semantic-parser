  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function will calculate the surface area of a cube by using the formula for the surface area of a cube, which is 6 times the length of one side squared. The input to the function will be the length of one side of the cube. This function assumes that the input is a positive number.\n\n**python**",
