  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code was designed to calculate the total surface area of a cuboid. However, it contained an error in the calculation of the lateral surface area. The correct formula for the lateral surface area of a cuboid is 2 * (length * width + length * height + width * height). Additionally, the top and bottom faces were not being accounted for correctly. To fix these issues, we need to correct the calculations and return the total surface area.\n\nCode",
