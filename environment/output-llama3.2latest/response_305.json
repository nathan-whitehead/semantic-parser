  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe original code had a bug where it tried to use the `next` function without providing an iterable as its first argument. The `next` function requires at least one more argument, which is the iterable to be searched for the specified value.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can rewrite the function to iterate through each word in the list and store the matched words in a variable instead of using the `next` function.\n\n# python",
