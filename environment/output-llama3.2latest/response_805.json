  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code calculates the sum of each sublist and stores them in a dictionary. It then finds the maximum sum that is greater than or equal to the initial max_sum, but it does not handle the case where all sublists have the same maximum sum correctly. The test case provided indicates that this issue causes the function to return an empty list when it should return the sublists with the highest sum.\n\n**python**",
