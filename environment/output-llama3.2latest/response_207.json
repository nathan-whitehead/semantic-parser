  "explanation": "Explanation\n==========\n\nThe given code tries to solve the problem of finding the longest repeating subsequences without having the same characters at the same positions. However, it has a logical error in the `find_longest_common_subsequence` function where it tries to access the variable `prev_subsequence` which is not defined.\n\nCode\n----",
