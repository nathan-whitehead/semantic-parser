  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code has multiple issues. The main problem is that it expects an arbitrary number of arguments after the index, which causes a TypeError when trying to call the function with three arguments. Additionally, it checks if the tuple has less than two elements and raises an IndexError, but this check should be done at the beginning of the function, not inside it. Finally, the code assumes that the first value in the tuple is always the index, which might not be the case.\n\nCode\n-----",
