  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe provided code attempts to find the intersection of elements in a list of tuples, regardless of their order. However, it contains a logical error where it tries to update the `common_elements` set with each tuple's frozenset value. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the uniqueness of elements across all tuples.\n\nTo fix this issue, we can use a different approach by converting each tuple into a set and finding their intersection. We will also ensure that the function takes only one argument (the list of tuples) and returns the result as a tuple.\n\nCode",
