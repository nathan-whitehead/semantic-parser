  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe given code attempts to add consecutive numbers from a list by using a stack data structure. However, the issue lies in the fact that the current implementation tries to subtract two lists, which is not possible. To fix this, we need to reconsider our approach and use a different method to achieve the desired result.\n\nCode\n-----",
