  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\nThe original code attempts to find the equilibrium index of the array by performing a binary search. However, there is an error in the logic where it incorrectly updates the left and right pointers. A new function has been created with comments to explain what each part does.\n\npython",
