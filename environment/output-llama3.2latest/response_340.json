  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function takes a list of numbers as input, sorts them in ascending order, and returns the sum of the three lowest positive numbers. The approach used is simple sorting followed by summation. If the list has less than 3 positive numbers, it will return the sum of all positive numbers in the list.\n\n**python**",
