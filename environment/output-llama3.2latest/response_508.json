  "explanation": "Explanation\nThe original code attempts to check if the common elements between two lists are in the same order. However, it contains an error where it only checks for equality instead of checking the corresponding index. \n\nThe corrected version uses a while loop to iterate over both lists at the same time and compare each element with its corresponding index.",
