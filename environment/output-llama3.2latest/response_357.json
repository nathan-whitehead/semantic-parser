  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe problem with the given code is that it assumes the first element of each tuple in the input list contains the value. However, in the test case provided, there are tuples where the first element does not contain the value (for example, `(5, 1)`). This code will fail to find the maximum value in such cases.\n\nCode\n----",
