  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe given code attempts to determine whether three points can form a valid triangle. However, the function is currently returning a boolean value instead of indicating whether the sides are valid or not. The code also doesn't handle cases where the input values are invalid (e.g., negative numbers). \n\nThe corrected version of the function will return 'Yes' if the triangle is valid and 'No' otherwise, with explanatory comments added for clarity.\n\npython",
