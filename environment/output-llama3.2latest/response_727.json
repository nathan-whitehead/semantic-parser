  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code uses `re.sub` to replace any character that is not alphanumeric or underscore (`_`) with an empty string. However, this approach fails when there are consecutive non-alphanumeric characters because it doesn't account for the fact that we want to remove all characters except letters and numbers. To fix this, we need to modify the regular expression pattern to match both individual non-alphanumeric characters and consecutive non-alphanumeric characters.\n\npython",
