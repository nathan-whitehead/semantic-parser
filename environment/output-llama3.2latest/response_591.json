  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function takes a list as an argument, checks if it has at least two elements, and then uses tuple unpacking to swap the first and last elements. This approach avoids modifying the original list and instead returns a new one with the elements interchanged. The function also includes type hints for clarity.\n\n**python**",
