  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code provided is almost correct but has a logical error in the line `if val >= i:`. The variable `i` represents the index of the tuple, not the value of the element at that index. This means that the condition `val >= i` will never be true because `val` is an integer and `i` is an index, so they are always different. \n\nTo fix this issue, we need to calculate the corresponding index of each value in the second tuple.\n\nCode\n----",
