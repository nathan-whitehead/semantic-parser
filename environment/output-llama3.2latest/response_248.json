  "explanation": "Explanation\n==========\n\nThe code provided attempts to calculate the harmonic sum of n-1 using a simple loop that adds the reciprocals of numbers from 1 to n-1. However, this approach is incorrect because it only considers up to n-1 terms and then returns a rounded value. To fix this, we need to modify the function to consider all numbers in the range.\n\nCode\n-----",
