  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe provided code has several issues. Firstly, the function `candidate` is being called with a string `'python'`, which is causing a NameError because `python` is not a valid variable or function in this context. The function itself also contains an incorrect approach to sorting lists of lists. It tries to sort the inner elements at a given index using the sorted() function, but it does not handle cases where this index is out of range for any list.\n\nCode\n-----",
