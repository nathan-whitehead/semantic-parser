  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function calculates the cube sum of the first n natural numbers by using a single loop and exponentiation. It starts with an initial sum of 0, then iterates over the range from 1 to n (inclusive), adding the cube of each number to the total sum. This approach avoids unnecessary calculations and provides an efficient solution.\n\n**python**",
