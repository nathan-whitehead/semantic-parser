  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function will take three parameters: length, width, and height, which represent the dimensions of a cuboid. The approach is to use the formula for the surface area of a cuboid: 2lw + 2lh + 2wh, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height respectively.\n\n**python**",
