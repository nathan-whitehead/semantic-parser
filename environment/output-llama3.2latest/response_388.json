  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe original code has a flaw in its logic for calculating the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n. It incorrectly returns different values based on whether the current power is divisible by 4, which is not a valid approach. A correct approach would be to continuously double the power until it exceeds n, and then return the previous power.\n\n**PYTHON**",
