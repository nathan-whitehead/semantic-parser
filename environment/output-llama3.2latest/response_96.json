  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function `candidate` calculates the number of divisors of a given integer by iterating through all numbers from 1 to the square root of the input and checking for divisibility. It uses a dictionary to store the count of each divisor and returns the sum of these counts. This approach is efficient as it reduces the search space with each iteration.\n\n**python**",
