  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code attempts to find the sum of first even and odd numbers in a given list. However, the issue lies in the fact that it's adding all even numbers to `even_sum` and all odd numbers to `odd_sum`, which is not the intended approach. The correct approach would be to add only the first even number and the first odd number separately.\n\nCode",
