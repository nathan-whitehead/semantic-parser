  "explanation": "Explanation\n================\n\nThe code provided attempts to solve the problem of checking whether one root of a quadratic equation is twice another. However, it has several issues. The main problem lies in its complexity and incorrect approach. The function does not correctly handle all cases and can return unexpected results.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to simplify our approach and make sure it handles all possible combinations of roots correctly. We will use a more straightforward method to check if any pair of roots satisfies the condition.\n\n\nPython",
