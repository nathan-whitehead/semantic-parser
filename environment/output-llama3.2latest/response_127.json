  "explanation": "Explanation\n================\n\nThe original code is attempting to multiply two integers without using the * operator. However, there are several issues with the implementation, including incorrect logic and missing edge cases. The corrected version will use a different approach that involves multiplying each digit of one number by the other and then summing these products.\n\nPython\n========",
