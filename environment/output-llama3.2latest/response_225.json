  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\n\nThe provided code attempts to find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array by using two pointers. However, it does not handle the case when only one element is present in the array correctly.\n\n\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the function to accept three parameters: `nums`, `left`, and `right`. The `left` and `right` parameters should represent the current search range for the minimum element. We also need to add a special case to handle when only one element is present in the array.\n\n\n\nHere is the corrected code:",
