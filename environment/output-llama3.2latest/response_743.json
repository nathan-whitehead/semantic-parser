  "explanation": "Explanation\n================\n\nThe provided function `candidate` is intended to rotate a list by a specified number of items to the right direction. However, there are two issues with this implementation. Firstly, it uses too many comments and can be simplified for better readability. Secondly, the function signature does not correctly handle multiple arguments.\n\nCode\n======",
