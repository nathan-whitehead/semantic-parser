  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code provided does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. The issue lies in the fact that it returns a boolean value, but the expected output is a string (\"Yes\" or \"No\"). Additionally, when the input string is valid binary, the function should return \"Yes\", not True.\n\nCode\n-----",
