  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe provided code is attempting to use the map function to iterate over each string in the input list and return a new list with each character of the strings. However, the lambda function used in the map() call does not produce the desired output.\n\nThe issue lies in the fact that map returns an iterator, which cannot be directly converted into a list without first converting it to a list using the built-in function list(). \n\nAlso, when passing multiple values (in this case, each string) to the lambda function, they must all have the same type. In Python, strings and characters are not the same type, so we need to convert them to strings.\n\nCode\n-----",
