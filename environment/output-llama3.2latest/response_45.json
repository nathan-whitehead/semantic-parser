  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe problem requires writing a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in a given array. The approach used here is to use the Euclidean algorithm, which is an efficient method for calculating GCD. This algorithm works by repeatedly replacing 'a' and 'b' with 'b' and 'a mod b', until 'b' becomes zero. At that point, 'a' is the GCD of the original two numbers.\n\n**python**",
