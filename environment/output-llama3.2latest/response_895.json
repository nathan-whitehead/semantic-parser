  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe code provided attempts to solve the problem by using dynamic programming. However, it has several issues. The main problem is that when filling up the dp arrays for `max_sum_right`, it tries to access an index that does not exist because the list indices start at 0. Also, there's incorrect calculation in `max_inclusive` and `max_exclusive`. Finally, `max_sum_left[i]` should be max of `max_sum_left[i-1]` or `max_sum_right[i-1] + nums[i]`, not both.\n\nCode\n-----",
