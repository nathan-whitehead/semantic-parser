  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe problem is asking us to write a function that calculates the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of an array, where each element in the array represents the maximum number of steps that can be made forward from that position. This is a classic dynamic programming problem. We will use a bottom-up approach and build up a table of minimum number of jumps required for each subarray.\n\n**PYTHON**",
