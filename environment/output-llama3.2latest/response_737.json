  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to check if a string starts with a vowel using regex. However, the regular expression pattern is not correctly defined. The `^` character is used as an anchor to match the start of the string, but it is missing from the pattern. Additionally, the function returns a boolean value instead of 'Valid' or 'Invalid' as expected.\n\n**python**",
