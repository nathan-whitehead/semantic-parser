  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function takes three sides of a triangle as input and checks if it's a scalene triangle (all sides different) by comparing them. It uses simple conditional statements to make the comparison. The result is returned as a boolean value indicating whether the triangle is scalene or not.\n\n**python**",
