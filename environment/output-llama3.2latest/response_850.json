  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\nThe original code checks for triangle inequality but not the sum of angles. In order to form a triangle with positive area, the sum of all three angles must be greater than 180 degrees.\n\n\nThe given test case `assert candidate(90,45,45)==True` is failing because the sum of two angles (45+45) equals 90 which isn't greater than 180. The current code does not handle this scenario and will return False for this input.\n\n\nTo fix this issue we need to add a condition to check if the sum of all three angles is greater than 180 degrees.\n\nCode\n-----",
