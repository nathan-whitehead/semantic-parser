  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe code provided attempts to check if the roots of a quadratic equation are reciprocal of each other. However, it contains an error in its return statement when one root is the reciprocal of the other. The correct approach should be that one root is 1/other root and not both being equal or both being equal to 1.\n\n**python**",
