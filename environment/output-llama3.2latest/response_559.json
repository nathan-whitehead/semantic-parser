  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code has several issues. The first problem is that it tries to use a single return statement with multiple values and a lambda function, which is not allowed in Python. Instead, the function should calculate the maximum sum that does not exceed the target sum and then check if it's greater than or equal to the target sum.\n\nThe second issue is that the code returns `max([max_global] if max_global <= target_sum else [0], key=lambda x: abs(x - target_sum))`, which will return 0 if the maximum global sum exceeds the target sum, but this is not what we want. We want to return the actual maximum sum.\n\nCode",
