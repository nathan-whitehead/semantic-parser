  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code attempts to combine the given list and tuple into a single data structure. However, it incorrectly returns a copy of the updated result as a single list, which is not consistent with the expected output format (i.e., `(9, 10, 5, 6, 7)`). To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to return individual elements instead of a single list.\n\nCode",
