  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function `candidate` calculates the vertex of a parabola given its equation in the form `y = ax^2 + bx + c`. It uses the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex, which is `-b / 2a`, to find the location of the vertex. The y-coordinate can be found by plugging this value back into the original equation.\n\n**python**",
