  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to find the nth super ugly number using a heap queue algorithm. However, it contains several issues such as incorrect logic for adding multiples into the heap and not properly updating the last ugly number found. The corrected version will address these issues and produce the correct result.\n\n**python**",
