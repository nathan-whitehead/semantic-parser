  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe generated code uses the `heapq.merge()` function to merge two sorted lists. However, this approach assumes that both input lists are already defined and passed as arguments to the function. The error message indicates that the function `candidate` is not defined when trying to call it.\n\nCode\n-----",
