  "explanation": "Explanation:\nThe given problem can be solved by calculating the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers using the formula $1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3 = \\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)^2$, and then subtracting the sum of the first n natural numbers which is given by $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.",
