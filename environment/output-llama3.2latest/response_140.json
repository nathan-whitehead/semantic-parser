  "explanation": "Explanation\n----------\n\nThe provided code attempts to extract elements that occur singly in the given tuple list. However, it has a logical flaw. The current implementation tries to extract single elements from sub-tuples, which is incorrect because the problem statement only deals with tuples of length 1. Additionally, the condition `elif len(elem) > 2` will lead to an infinite recursion when encountering nested tuples of any depth.\n\nCode",
