  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function checks if the parity of a given integer is even. It uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder when the number is divided by 2, and then checks if this remainder is 0 (indicating even parity). If it's not 0, the function immediately returns False; otherwise, it returns True.\n\n**python**",
