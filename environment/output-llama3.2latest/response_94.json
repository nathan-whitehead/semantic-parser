  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe original code was attempting to find the minimum value in a list of tuples, but it had two issues. Firstly, it was using `tuples.index(min_tuple)` to get the index of the minimum tuple, which is incorrect because `index()` returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element, not the index of the tuple itself. Secondly, it was returning a dictionary with the value and index of the minimum tuple, but the test case expected only the value.\n\nCode\n-----",
