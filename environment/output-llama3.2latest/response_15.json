  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code attempts to split a string at lowercase letters by iterating over each character and maintaining a current substring. However, the issue arises when trying to append characters to the `substring` variable because the variable is only defined within the scope of the if statement condition (`if char.islower():`). To fix this, we need to define `substring` as a global variable or encapsulate it within a function.\n\nCode",
