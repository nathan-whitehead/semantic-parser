  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided Python function will take as input a list of integers and return the count of negative numbers within that list. It uses a simple approach by iterating through each element in the list, checking if it is less than zero, and incrementing a counter variable whenever such an element is found.\n\n**python**",
