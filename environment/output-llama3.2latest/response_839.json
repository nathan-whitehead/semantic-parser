  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function will take a list of tuples as input, and return a new list with the tuples sorted alphabetically by their first item. This is achieved using Python's built-in sorting functionality, which sorts elements in ascending order by default. The `key` parameter is used to specify that the tuples should be sorted based on the first item.\n\n**python**",
