  "explanation": "Explanation\n----------\n\nThe original code attempts to merge three dictionaries into a single dictionary, but it has several issues. The main problem is that it's trying to return the values from all input dictionaries using `.items()`, which doesn't make sense because we're merging keys and their corresponding values.\n\nWe can fix this by simply returning the merged dictionary directly. Additionally, the code should handle cases where there are duplicate keys in the input dictionaries.\n\nCode\n----",
