  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function checks if there are any duplicate elements in an array of integers. It uses a set data structure, which automatically removes duplicates, and then checks the length of the original array against the length of the set. If they are equal, it means that all elements were unique.\n\n**python**",
