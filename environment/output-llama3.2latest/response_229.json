  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe original code attempts to solve the problem by separating the array into two lists of negative and non-negative numbers, merging them in sorted order, and then appending any remaining elements. However, the issue arises when the function is called with an argument (the expected number of -1's) which causes it to be treated as a keyword argument.\n\nThe corrected code addresses this issue by not accepting any arguments for the `candidate` function, using the array directly.\n\n\nPython",
