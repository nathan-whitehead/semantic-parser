  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function will take a list as input and return a dictionary where each key is an element from the list, and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in the list. The approach used here is by iterating over the list and using a dictionary to store the frequency of each element.\n\n**python**",
