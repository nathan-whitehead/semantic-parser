  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code attempts to check if all characters in a string are the same by first removing non-alphabetic characters and converting to lowercase. It then checks for each unique character if its count is greater than 1, returning False as soon as it finds one. However, this approach fails when there's only one character that appears more than once because the `count` method returns a value of -1 in such cases due to invalid literal for int() while counting duplicate characters.\n\nThe corrected code uses Python's built-in set data structure and dictionary operations for an efficient solution.\n\nPython",
