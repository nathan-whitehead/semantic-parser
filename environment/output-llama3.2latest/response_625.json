  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe provided code attempts to solve the problem of interchanging the first and last elements of a list. However, it has two issues - the function is named `interchange_first_last` instead of `candidate`, which causes the test case to fail because the function name is not defined as required.\n\nCode\n-----",
