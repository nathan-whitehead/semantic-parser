  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe generated code attempts to find the most significant bit number that is also a set bit by iterating through each bit of the input number from right to left. However, there are two main issues with this approach: it returns the index of the least significant set bit instead of the most significant one, and it does not handle numbers with only one set bit correctly.\n\nCode\n-----",
