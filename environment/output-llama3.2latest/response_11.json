  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code has a logical error. The line `new_s = new_s[:last_occurrence-1] + new_s[last_occurrence+1:]` is incorrect because it should be `new_s = new_s[:last_occurrence] + new_s[last_occurrence+1:]`. This is because we want to remove the last occurrence of the character, not the character before the last occurrence.\n\nCode\n-----",
