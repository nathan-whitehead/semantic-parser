  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe code provided does not handle cases where the first part of the list has a length greater than `n`. It also assumes that if the total length of the list is less than `n`, it should raise an error, but in this case, we want to return all elements and just split them into two parts. The function name should be defined as per the test requirement.\n\n\npython",
