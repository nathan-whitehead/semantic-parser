  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This approach is efficient and accurate, making it suitable for finding GCDs of large numbers as well. The function takes two integer arguments and returns their GCD.\n\n**python**",
