  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code was attempting to calculate the nth Delannoy number using recursion and memoization. However, it had a few issues, including missing function definition and incorrect usage of `candidate` as a variable. To fix these issues, we need to refactor the code to define the `candidate` function correctly.\n\n**python**",
