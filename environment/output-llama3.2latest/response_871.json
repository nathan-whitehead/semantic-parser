  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function checks if two input strings are rotations of each other. A rotation is a rearrangement of characters where every character in one string is shifted to its corresponding position in another string. This function achieves this by comparing the concatenation of each string with itself, effectively checking for all possible rotations.\n\n**python**",
