  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code provided calculates the sum of inverses of divisors for multiple inputs. However, the issue lies in the handling of cases where `n` is a perfect square. In such cases, two identical values are being added to the divisor sum (the square root of `n` and its inverse), which results in an incorrect total sum.\n\nCode",
