  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function identifies non-prime numbers by checking if a number has any divisors other than 1 and itself. It uses a loop to iterate through all numbers up to the square root of the input number, and checks if the input number is divisible by any of these numbers.\n\n**python**",
