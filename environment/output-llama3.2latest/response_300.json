  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the count of all binary sequences of length 2n where the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits. The approach used here is to use two nested loops to generate all possible binary sequences of length 2n, and then check if the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits for each sequence.\n\n**python**",
