  "explanation": "Explanation\n----------\n\nThe original code attempts to find the index of the first occurrence of a target value in a sorted array. However, it contains an issue where the function `candidate` is called before it's defined. To fix this, we need to move the definition of the `candidate` function above the test cases.\n\nCode",
