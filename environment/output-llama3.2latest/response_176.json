  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe original code attempts to validate whether the input values form a valid triangle by checking if the absolute difference between the lengths of any two sides is less than the length of the third side. However, this check is not sufficient to guarantee that the input values form a valid triangle. A correct implementation should also verify that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the remaining side.\n\nCode\n-----",
