  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code has a logical error. The issue lies in the line `count = sum(1 for elem in lst[i] if isinstance(elem, int) and elem % 2 == 0)`. Here, we're trying to count even numbers in the sublist at index `i`, but this approach is incorrect because `lst[i]` returns a single element, not the entire sublist.\n\nInstead, we should use list comprehension with double indices (`i+1`) to get the elements from both sides of the current index. If an odd index has only one element, it means that's also an even number of elements in that position.\n\nCode",
