  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function is designed to calculate the frequency of a target number within a given list. It uses a dictionary to store each element as a key and its frequency as the value, then checks if the target number exists in the dictionary. This approach ensures a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input array.\n\n**python**",
