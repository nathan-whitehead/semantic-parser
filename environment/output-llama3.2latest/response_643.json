  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code was attempting to create a function that checks if a word contains the letter 'z', but not at the start or end of the word. The approach was close, but the error message indicated that the code was trying to run as a script instead of a function. Additionally, the condition in the function could be simplified and made more readable.\n\nCode\n-----",
