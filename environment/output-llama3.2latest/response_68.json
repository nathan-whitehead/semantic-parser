  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe problem requires us to write a Python function that checks if an array is monotonic. A monotonic array is one where every element on the left side of the array is less than or equal to the corresponding element on the right side, or vice versa. This can be achieved by checking for the presence of any pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second.\n\n**python**",
