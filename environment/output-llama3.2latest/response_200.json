  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe problem is asking for the indices of the maximum value(s) in a given list. This can be solved using the built-in `max` function in Python, which returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. We will use this function to find the maximum value and its index.\n\n**python**",
