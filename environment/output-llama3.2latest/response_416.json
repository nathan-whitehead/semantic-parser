  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe original code was attempting to find the maximum sum by dividing a number into three parts recursively. However, it had several issues, including incorrect base cases, invalid recursive calls, and unnecessary computations. The corrected code uses a more efficient approach by only considering the maximum possible sum for each division of the number.\n\n# python",
