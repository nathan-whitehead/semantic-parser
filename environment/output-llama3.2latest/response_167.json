  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe original code attempts to calculate the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n by taking the base-2 logarithm and shifting 1 to the highest bit position using bitwise left shift operator. However, this approach fails when n is 0 because math.log2(0) raises a ValueError.\n\n# Python",
