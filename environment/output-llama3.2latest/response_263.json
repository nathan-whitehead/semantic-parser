  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code attempts to merge two dictionaries into one. However, the approach is incorrect and results in an AttributeError when trying to call the 'extend' method on an integer value.\n\nThe corrected function uses a different approach to handle values of different types. If a key exists in both dictionaries but has different values, the correct value will be preserved in the resulting dictionary.\n\nCode",
