  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function uses Python's built-in `map` function in combination with a lambda function to add corresponding elements from two lists. The approach is to use `map` to apply the addition operation to each pair of elements from the input lists, effectively creating a new list with the summed results.\n\n**python**",
