  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe problem asks us to write a Python function that calculates the frequency of each element in a given list of lists. We can use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to achieve this. The approach is to iterate over each sublist, and for each element, increment its count in the `Counter` object.\n\n**python**",
