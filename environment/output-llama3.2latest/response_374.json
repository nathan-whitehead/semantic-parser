  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe original code is not producing the expected output due to the sorting of the permutations before adding them to the result list. This is causing duplicates to be removed because each permutation is being sorted and compared against others in the list, resulting in the incorrect assertion error.\n\nCode\n----",
