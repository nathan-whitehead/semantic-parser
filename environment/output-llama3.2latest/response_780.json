  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code was attempting to calculate the combinations of sums with tuples. However, it contained a logical error and used `itertools.product` incorrectly. The `itertools.product(*numbers)` line was trying to unpack all numbers from each tuple separately, resulting in an error.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to iterate over each number individually within the tuple and calculate its sum with every other number in the tuple.\n\n**python**",
