  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe original code attempted to calculate the number of substrings with same first and last characters. However, it introduced several issues such as incorrect handling of character pairs, usage of an undefined variable `total_count`, and failure to consider all possible substrings. The corrected function iterates over each substring of the input string, checks if its first and last characters are the same, and counts them.\n\nPython",
