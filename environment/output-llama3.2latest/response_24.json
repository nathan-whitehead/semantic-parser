  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe original code has a few issues. The main problem lies in the line where it checks if the input is a valid binary string using `set(binary).issubset({'0', '1'})`. This will raise an error because the `set` function doesn't work with integers. We need to convert the integer into a string first.\n\nAnother issue is that the code assumes that the input will always be a non-negative integer, but it does not handle this case explicitly. \n\nFinally, the line where it converts binary to decimal uses slicing and the sum function incorrectly. The correct way to do this would be to initialize a variable with the decimal equivalent of 0, then add 2 to this variable for each '1' in the binary string.\n\nCode\n-----",
