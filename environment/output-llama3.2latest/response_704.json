  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe provided code attempts to calculate the harmonic sum of n-1 using a simple iterative approach. However, it contains an error in its calculation. The issue lies in the fact that the loop only runs from 2 to n-1, which means the last term (which is 1/n) is not included in the sum.\n\nCode\n-----",
