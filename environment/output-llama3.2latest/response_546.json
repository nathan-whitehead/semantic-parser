  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code provided has a logical error. The issue is with the loop starting index being `len(string) - 1` instead of `0`. This means that when `char` is found at index `i`, it will also be counted as an occurrence before `char` itself. Also, since Python uses zero-based indexing, if we find the character at index `n-1`, its corresponding actual position in string is `(n-1)`. So to get the last occurrence of a character we should iterate until we reach our target character, and then iterate again from start until that point.\n\nCode\n-----",
