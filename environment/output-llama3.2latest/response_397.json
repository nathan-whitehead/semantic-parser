  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe problem requires writing a function that takes three numbers as input and returns their median. The approach is to simply compare the numbers and return the middle value. If the numbers are equal, we can consider them as having two middle values (the mean of the three), but in this case, we will only consider one median.\n\n**Python**",
