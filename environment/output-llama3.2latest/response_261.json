  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe provided code attempts to perform element-wise mathematical division across two tuples. However, the test case assertion fails because it doesn't account for cases where one of the divisor values is zero. The function tries to append infinity when the divisor is zero but still attempts a float conversion on the quotient, which will fail if the quotient is not a number.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the function to raise a ValueError when encountering a non-numeric value in either tuple and handle division by zero errors more robustly. The corrected function should also ensure that it only performs divisions where the divisor is non-zero.\n\nCode\n-----",
