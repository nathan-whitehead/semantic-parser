  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe provided code attempts to calculate the minimum number of operations required to make two numbers equal by finding the absolute difference between them. However, this approach only works for cases where num1 and num2 are already close to each other. To fix this issue, we need to consider all possible operations (addition or subtraction) that can be applied to one number to transform it into the other.\n\n# python",
