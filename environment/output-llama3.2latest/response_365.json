  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function `candidate` takes an integer as input and returns its digit count. The approach is to convert the integer into a string, iterate over each character (digit) in the string, and increment a counter variable for each digit found. This method is straightforward and efficient.\n\n**python**",
