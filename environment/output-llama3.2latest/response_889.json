  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function `candidate` takes a list of lists as input, reverses each sublist using slicing, and returns the modified list. This approach is simple and efficient because it doesn't require any additional data structures or loops. The function uses Python's built-in list slicing feature to reverse each sublist.\n\n**python**",
