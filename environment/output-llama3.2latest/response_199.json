  "explanation": "Explanation\n==========\n\nThe provided function attempts to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to a given number. However, it contains an incorrect condition for returning the result when `result` equals `n`. The correct approach should be to return `result` directly if `result` is equal to `n`, as this ensures that we get the highest power of 2 when `n` itself is a power of 2.\n\nCode\n-----",
