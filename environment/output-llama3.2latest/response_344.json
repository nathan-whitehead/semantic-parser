  "explanation": "Explanation\n==========\n\nThe original code is attempting to find numbers with odd factors in a given range. However, it's incorrect because the condition `num % i == 0` will always be false for prime numbers when checking divisors up to sqrt(n), since they only have one divisor that is odd (themselves). The corrected function should check if all divisors are even.\n\nCode\n=====",
