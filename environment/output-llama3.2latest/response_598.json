  "explanation": "**Explanation**\n\nThis function checks if a given number is an Armstrong number, which is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The approach used here is simple and straightforward, it calculates the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this with the original number. If they are equal, then the number is an Armstrong number.\n\n**python**",
