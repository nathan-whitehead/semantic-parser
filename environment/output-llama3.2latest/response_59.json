  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code attempts to calculate the nth octagonal number using a mathematical formula. However, it does not correctly define the function or handle invalid input. The error message indicates that the variable `python` is not defined, but this is not relevant to the calculation of the octagonal number.\n\nThe code also uses the `math.sqrt(8)` method which will throw an error if the result is not a integer when divided by 4. To solve these issues, we need to improve the calculation and validate input before execution.\n\nCode\n-----",
