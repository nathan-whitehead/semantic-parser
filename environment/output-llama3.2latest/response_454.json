  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe issue with the original code is that it only checks if the last character of the input word is 'z', but it doesn't check if any other occurrence of 'z' exists in the word. The test case provided indicates that a match should be found for words containing multiple 'z's. To fix this, we need to modify the function to search for 'z' anywhere in the word.\n\nCode\n----",
