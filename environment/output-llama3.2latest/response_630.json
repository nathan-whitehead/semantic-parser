  "explanation": "Explanation:\nThe original code calculates the adjacent coordinates within a 100x100 boundary. However, this restricts the output since it only includes coordinates that are not at the boundaries of the grid. To fix this, we need to modify the condition in the if statement to include all possible coordinates.\n\nCode:",
