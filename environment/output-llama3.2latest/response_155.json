  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe code attempts to toggle all even bits of a given number using bitwise operations. However, the approach is incorrect and leads to the error message. The `even_mask` is set as `0x5555`, which only toggles the least significant two bits (2^0 and 2^1) of the input number `n`. This does not achieve the goal of toggling all even bits.\n\nThe `mask` variable, `(1 << 16) - 1`, is also unnecessary and can be removed. The main issue with the code is that it tries to use bitwise XOR (`^`) operation incorrectly.\n\nCode\n-----",
