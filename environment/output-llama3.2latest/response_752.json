  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code provided attempts to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number using memoization. However, it has a bug in its calculation logic. The issue lies in the line where it calculates the next Jacobsthal number: `next_jacobsthal_num = (jacobsthal_nums[i-1] * (jacobsthal_nums[i-1] + 2*jacobsthal_nums[i-2]))`. \n\nIn this formula, the correct calculation should be `(jacobsthal_nums[i-1] + jacobsthal_nums[i-2])` without the multiplication by `jacobsthal_nums[i-1]`.\n\nCode\n----",
