  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code was attempting to solve the problem by checking for a concatenation of two substrings in a single string. However, it contained several issues including an incorrect initial index value and missing test cases. Additionally, the code did not handle the function correctly when given two arguments.\n\nCode\n----",
