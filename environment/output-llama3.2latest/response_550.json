  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code has a logical error in the implementation of the binary search algorithm. It incorrectly updates the `low` and `high` pointers, leading to an incorrect result. The corrected code refactors this logic into two separate loops for finding the maximum element in the unrotated part of the array.\n\n**python**",
