  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function takes a list of lists as input and returns the maximum sum of elements in any sublist. It achieves this by using a single pass through the outer list, keeping track of the current sum and the maximum sum found so far. This approach is efficient because it avoids redundant calculations.",
