  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code has a function named `isvalid`, but it's not being used correctly. The main issue is that the function is not actually checking if a value is valid or not, and it's returning `True` for any positive number. We need to define a new function called `candidate` that takes a tuple as input and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are valid according to some criteria.\n\n**python**",
