  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\nThe code generated by the user uses a lambda function to find lists with the same length and iterates over them to keep track of the list with minimum length. However, this approach is inefficient as it involves unnecessary iterations and comparisons. A more efficient approach would be to use the built-in `min` function with a custom key to find the list with minimum length.\n\n\nCode\n-----",
