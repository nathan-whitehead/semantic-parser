  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe original code attempts to find the largest possible value of k such that k modulo x is y. However, there are a few issues with this approach: \n- The initial value of `k` should be 0 instead of 1.\n- We need to adjust our stopping condition and logic for when we have found the correct value of `k`.\n- Without a correct stopping condition, we risk going over `max_k`, which is not desired.\n\nCode\n-----",
