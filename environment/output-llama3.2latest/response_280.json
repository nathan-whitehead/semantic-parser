  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe given code implements a sequential search algorithm to find an element in a list. However, the problem lies in the return type of the function. The function is expected to return a tuple containing a boolean value and the index of the target element if found. But currently, it only returns the index when the target element is found and -1 otherwise. \n\n# python",
