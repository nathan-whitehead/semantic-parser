  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function calculates the surface area of a cone using its radius and height. The formula for the surface area of a cone is \u03c0r(r + \u221a(h^2 + r^2)), where r is the radius and h is the height. This function takes these values as input and returns the calculated surface area.\n\n**python**",
