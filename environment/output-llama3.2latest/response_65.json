  "explanation": "Explanation\n----------\n\nThe issue here is that the function `recursive_list_sum` is being called before it's defined. This is because Python reads code from top to bottom, so when it encounters a call to `candidate`, it hasn't seen the definition of `candidate` yet.\n\nTo fix this, we can move the definition of `candidate` above its first use. We should also add some error checking to ensure that all elements in the list are numbers or lists, not other types of data. This will help prevent a TypeError when trying to add non-numeric values together.\n\nCode",
