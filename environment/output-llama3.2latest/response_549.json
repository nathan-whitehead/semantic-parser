  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function will take an integer `n` as input and return the sum of the fifth power of the first `n` odd natural numbers. The approach used is a simple loop that iterates over the range from 1 to `2*n-1`, calculates the fifth power of each odd number, and sums them up.\n\n**python**",
