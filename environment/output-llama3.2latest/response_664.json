  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function calculates the sum of all even numbers up to a given even number and then divides by 2 to get the average. It starts from 2, checks if each number is even, and keeps adding it to the total until it reaches the target even number. The result is returned as the average.\n\n**python**",
