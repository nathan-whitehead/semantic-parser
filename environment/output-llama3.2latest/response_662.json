  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe code attempts to sort the lists in a dictionary using a custom function. However, it fails because the sorting is done directly on the list within the dictionary, which can be modified. Instead, we need to create a new sorted list and return it as the value.\n\n**python**",
