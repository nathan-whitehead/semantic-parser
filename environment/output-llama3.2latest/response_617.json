  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code attempts to solve the problem by creating a dynamic programming (DP) table to store the minimum number of jumps required to reach each point in the plane. However, it incorrectly updates the DP values and does not handle the extra positional argument correctly.\n\nCode\n----",
