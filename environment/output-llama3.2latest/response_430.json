  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to calculate the directrix of a parabola based on its coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, it contains several logical errors and does not correctly handle different cases. The main issue is that the function calls itself recursively without any base case, causing an infinite recursion and ultimately leading to the error.\n\n**python**",
