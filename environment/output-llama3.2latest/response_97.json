  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function takes as input a list of lists (`lst_of_lists`) and returns a dictionary where each key is an element from the inner lists and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in the entire list. This approach utilizes Python's built-in data structures, such as dictionaries, to efficiently count the occurrences of each element.\n\n**python**",
