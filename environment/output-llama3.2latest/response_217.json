  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe provided code attempts to find the first repeated character in a given string by iterating over each character and checking if it's already in the `char_set`. However, the issue lies in the fact that the function raises an error when no repeats are found, whereas the problem requires returning a specific value (in this case, '\\0') instead.\n\nCode\n----",
