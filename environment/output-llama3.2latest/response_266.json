  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function calculates the lateral surface area of a cube by multiplying the length of one side of the cube with the total number of sides that are not faces (i.e., 4 for a cube). This is based on the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube, which is 4a^2, where 'a' represents the length of a side. The function returns this calculated value.\n\n**python**",
