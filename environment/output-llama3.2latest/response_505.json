  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe provided code attempts to solve the problem of moving all zeroes to the end of a given array by using two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end. However, there is an issue with the swapping logic that can lead to an infinite loop. The issue lies in the fact that the left pointer moves forward as soon as it encounters a zero element, but the right pointer also moves backward to find the first non-zero element on the left side of the current index. This can cause the pointers to meet prematurely if all elements are zeroes.\n\nCode\n-----",
