  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe given code calculates the sum of all digits of a base to the specified power. However, it only considers the last digit of the product and does not account for carry-over when multiplying two numbers together. This results in incorrect calculations for powers greater than 1.\n\nCode\n----",
