  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe original code uses `map` and a lambda function to create a new list with the difference of each pair of corresponding elements from two lists. However, this approach assumes that the input lists have the same length, which may not always be the case. The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the `candidate` function is not defined.\n\nCode\n-----",
