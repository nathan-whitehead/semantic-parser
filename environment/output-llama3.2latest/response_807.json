  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function iterates over each number in the input list and checks if it's odd by using the modulus operator. If an odd number is found, it immediately returns that number. This approach ensures efficiency as it stops iterating as soon as it finds the first odd number.\n\n**python**",
