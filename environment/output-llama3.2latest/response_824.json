  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided Python function will take a list of integers as input and return a new list containing only the odd numbers. The approach is to use a for loop to iterate over each number in the input list, check if it's even using the modulus operator, and if not, append it to the output list.\n\n**python**",
