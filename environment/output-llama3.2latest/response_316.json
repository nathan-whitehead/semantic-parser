  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe code attempts to find the index of the last occurrence of a target number in a sorted array using a modified binary search approach. However, it contains incorrect logic that causes the result to be off by one position. The issue lies in the line `right = mid - 1` when the middle element matches the target, which is incorrect because we want to continue searching from the middle index instead of moving left.\n\n# python",
