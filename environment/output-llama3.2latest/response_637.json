  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe given code has a logical error. It checks if the maximum possible profit is greater than or equal to zero and if there's any loss, but it doesn't consider all scenarios correctly. The correct approach should check if the amount can be exactly covered by the cost without leaving any remainder. \n\nCode\n----",
