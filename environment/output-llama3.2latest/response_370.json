  "explanation": "Explanation\n=====================================\n\nThe provided code attempts to sort a tuple by its float element. However, the approach is incorrect as it appends infinity values to the result list when the input element is not a float, which causes issues during sorting. To fix this, we need to modify the function to correctly handle non-float elements and sort the tuple based on the float elements.\n\nCode\n-----",
