  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe code attempts to find the missing number in a sorted array by comparing each element with the minimum possible number and returning the difference if it finds a number greater than the minimum plus one. However, this approach does not work for all cases, especially when the missing number is at the beginning of the array. \n\nWe need to modify the code to correctly identify the starting point of the sorted sequence before iterating through it.\n\n**python**",
