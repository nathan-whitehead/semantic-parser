  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe provided code attempts to calculate the total number of cubes of size k in a cube of size n. However, it contains an error where the edge length of the smaller cube is calculated as `n ** (1/3)`, which would result in a non-integer value and cause issues with integer division later on.\n\nThe issue lies in the line `total_count = int((n ** 3) / (small_cube_edge ** 3))`. This line divides the total volume of the large cube by the volume of the small cube, but it does not account for the fact that each cube has a non-uniform size. To fix this issue, we need to adjust our approach.\n\nCode\n----",
