  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code was attempting to solve the problem of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in an array. However, it had several issues, including a lack of input validation and incorrect usage of sets. The error message indicates that the function is being called with two arguments (the array and the expected output), but the function definition only accepts one argument (the array).\n\nCode",
