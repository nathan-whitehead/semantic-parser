  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe code has several issues. It sorts the entire tuple and then selects the middle elements as min_k and max_k, but it doesn't handle the case where k is greater than half of the tuple length. Also, the selection process for max_k and min_k can result in duplicate values.\n\n**python**",
