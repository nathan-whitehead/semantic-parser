  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\nThe original code attempts to find the smallest triangular number with n digits by iterating over increasing values of i and calculating the corresponding triangular numbers. However, the issue arises when it tries to return `i - 1`, which is incorrect because Python uses zero-based indexing. The correct approach is to add a counter variable that increments with each iteration and returns its value.\n\nCode\n-----",
