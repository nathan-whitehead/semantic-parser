  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function takes two dictionaries as input and returns a new dictionary with combined values. It achieves this by iterating over the key-value pairs of both input dictionaries, checking if each key is present in both dictionaries, and adding the corresponding values to the output dictionary. If a key is not common to both dictionaries, it is only included in the output if it exists in either of the input dictionaries.\n\n**python**",
