  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe original code attempts to calculate the height of a binary tree using recursion. However, it has an incorrect base case and does not handle nodes with only one child correctly. The corrected function will use memoization to store the heights of nodes for efficiency.\n\n**python**",
