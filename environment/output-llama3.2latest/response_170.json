  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function will take a list and two indices as input, and return the sum of all numbers in the list within the given range. It uses slicing to extract the relevant sublist from the original list, then calculates the sum using Python's built-in `sum()` function. This approach is straightforward and easy to understand.\n\n**python**",
