  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided function will calculate the smallest multiple that is divisible by all numbers from 1 to `n`. It uses a loop to iterate through each number and finds the least common multiple (LCM) with the previously calculated LCM. This approach ensures that the result is correct even when `n` is large.\n\n**python**",
