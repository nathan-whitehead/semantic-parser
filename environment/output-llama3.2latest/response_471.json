  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code provided does not accept the number of elements in the array as an argument. It only accepts two parameters, `arr` and `n`. However, it seems like we need to pass three parameters: `arr`, `n`, and another integer for which we want to find the remainder of the product.\n\nCode\n----",
