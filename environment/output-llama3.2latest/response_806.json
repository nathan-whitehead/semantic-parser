  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function `candidate` uses a simple iteration approach to traverse through the input string, keeping track of the maximum run encountered so far. It maintains a variable `max_run` to store this information and updates it whenever a longer run is found. The function returns the value of `max_run`.\n\n**python**",
