  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to solve the problem by checking if each number in the sequence is strictly less than its previous value. However, this approach fails when the input sequence is empty or contains only one element. The error message indicates that the function should return True for an empty sequence and False for a decreasing sequence.\n\n**python**",
