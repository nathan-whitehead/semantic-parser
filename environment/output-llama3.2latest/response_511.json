  "explanation": "**EXPLANATION**\nThe code attempts to find the minimum sum of factors of a given number by iterating through all possible factors and calculating their sums. However, it contains an error where it calculates `current_sum` twice with the same value instead of adding both factors together.\n\n**python**",
