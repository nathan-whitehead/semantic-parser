  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\nThe code provided does not correctly handle February as a month with 28 days. The current implementation returns `True` for months other than February and the specified months with 28 days, which is incorrect.\n\nTo fix this, we need to add an additional check for February, but only in non-leap years. We can use the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the year when divided by 4, which will be 0 if it's a leap year.\n\n\nCode\n-----",
