  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe generated code attempts to calculate a dog's age in human years based on its breed and size. However, the function requires two arguments: `breed_size` and `human_year`, but does not account for when these two variables are passed to the function.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the function to accept both `breed_size` and `human_year` as required positional arguments.\n\nCode\n----",
