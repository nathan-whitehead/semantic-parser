  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function takes a string as input and returns the first non-repeated character. It uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the string, then iterates over the string again to find the first character with a count of 1. This approach ensures that we only consider unique characters.\n\n**python**",
