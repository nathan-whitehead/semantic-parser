  "explanation": "Explanation\n=====================================\n\nThe provided problem can be solved using a simple greedy algorithm. The idea is to start with the largest square and keep subtracting it from the remaining sum until we reach zero or cannot subtract any more. This approach ensures that we use the minimum number of squares.\n\n`python`",
