  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function will take a list of numbers as input, then iterate through the list to find the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers. It will return these differences as a new list. The approach used is simple and straightforward, making it easy to understand and implement.\n\n\n**python**",
