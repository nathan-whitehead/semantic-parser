  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function generates a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to n raised to the power of 2 in spiral order. It uses nested loops to iterate over the matrix and fill it with values in a spiral pattern, starting from the top-left corner and moving clockwise. The function returns the generated matrix as a list of lists.\n\n**python**",
