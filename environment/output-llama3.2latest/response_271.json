  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function will calculate the sum of the fifth power of the first n even natural numbers. It uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 2 to 2n, and calculates the fifth power of each even number using exponentiation operator (**). The result is accumulated in a variable `total_sum`.\n\n**python**",
