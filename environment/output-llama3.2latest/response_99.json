  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe given code attempts to convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent. However, the issue lies in the fact that it appends the remainder (`r`) to the `binary` string before updating the `n` variable with the quotient (`q`). This approach is incorrect because it would result in an incorrect binary representation.\n\nTo fix this, we need to append the quotient (`q`) to the `binary` string instead of the remainder. Additionally, we should return '0' only when the `binary` string is empty, which means the input number was 0.\n\nCode",
