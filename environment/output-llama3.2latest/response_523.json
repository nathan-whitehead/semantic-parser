  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to use a regular expression pattern with the `re.fullmatch` function to check if the string matches certain criteria, including having at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one number, and a specified length. However, this approach has several issues: it does not correctly handle variable-length strings, it includes the length in the regular expression pattern which is incorrect, and it returns a boolean value instead of providing error messages as requested.\n\n**python**",
