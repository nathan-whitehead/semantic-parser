  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code is attempting to calculate the sum of an arithmetic progression. However, it contains a logical error that causes it to produce incorrect results for certain inputs. The issue lies in the calculation of the total sum using the formula `total = (num_terms / 2) * (2 * first_term + (num_terms - 1) * common_difference)`. This formula is correct, but the code does not handle cases where the division by 2 results in a fractional number. \n\nAdditionally, the function name and docstring do not match the required output of the function, which should be an integer.\n\nCode\n----",
