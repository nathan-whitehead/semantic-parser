  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\nThe code has several issues. The first problem is that the even pair calculation logic is repeated for each different index of the pairs. This results in incorrect calculations and inefficient computation.\n\n\nThe second issue is that there are no subfunctions to calculate products, making it difficult to read and understand.\n\n\nFinally, the print statement has been removed as per the rules but its presence caused an error during runtime.\n\n\nCode\n-----",
