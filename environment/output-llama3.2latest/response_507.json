  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to remove specific words from a given list by iterating over each word to remove and filtering it out using list comprehension. However, the approach is incorrect as it modifies the indices of the remaining elements in the list during the iteration, causing all subsequent elements to shift down one index. A correct approach would be to create a new list with the unwanted words filtered out.\n\n**python**",
