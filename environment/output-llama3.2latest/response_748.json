  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function uses regular expressions (regex) to find words starting with capital letters and adds spaces before them. It also handles punctuation attached to these words, ensuring that it only inserts a space when a word starts with a capital letter and is not followed by another word or punctuation. This approach ensures the output string has spaces between words as required.\n\n**python**",
