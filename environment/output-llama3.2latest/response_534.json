  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\n\nThe code is attempting to find a pattern within the main string. However, it's not correctly returning the location of the pattern in the original string.\n\n\nThe issue arises from the `find()` method's behavior, which returns `-1` if the pattern is not found, and then the subsequent `if index == -1:` check will always be true, causing an incorrect return value.\n\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the code to correctly handle the case where the pattern is found, as well as when it's not. We can achieve this by removing the `find()` method altogether and using a loop to iterate through the main string instead.\n\n\nCode\n-----",
