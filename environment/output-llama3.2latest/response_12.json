  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function solves the problem by defining a helper function to calculate the sum of each row, and then using the built-in `sorted` function with a custom sorting key.\n\nThe approach is to use Python's built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of each row in the matrix. The `sorted` function is used with a lambda function as the key to sort the rows based on their sums.\n\n\n**python**",
