  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code has a logical error in the calculation of the Carol numbers. The line `carols[i] = i*carols[i-1]` is incorrect because it's multiplying the current index by the previous term, which doesn't follow the recursive definition of the Carol numbers.\n\nA correct approach would be to use the recursive formula `C(i+1) = i*C(i) + C(i-1)` and store the results in an array. The base case is `C(0) = 1`.\n\n**python**",
