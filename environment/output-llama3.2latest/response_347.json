  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided code attempts to calculate the total number of squares that can fit within a given rectangle. However, it incorrectly increments the count when both `num_squares_len` and `num_squares_width` are zero, which occurs when the square size is greater than the minimum side length of the rectangle. This issue leads to incorrect results.\n\n**python**",
