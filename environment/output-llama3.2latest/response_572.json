  "explanation": "Explanation\n==========\n\nThe code provided has several issues. The main problem is that the `count` method of a list returns the count of elements in the entire list, not just for each number individually. This causes incorrect results when checking if a number's occurrences are more than 1.\n\nAnother issue is that after removing numbers from the original list, the function does not return the updated list. Instead, it only returns the result list.\n\nFinally, the code has several unnecessary operations and data structures, making it less efficient and harder to understand.\n\n\npython",
