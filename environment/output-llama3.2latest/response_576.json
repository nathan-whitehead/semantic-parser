  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code had a logic error and the function was not designed correctly. It first tried to find any subarray within itself, which made no sense. Then it tried to find `arr1` as a substring of `arr2`, which is also incorrect because `arr1` can't be a substring of another array in Python.\nThe corrected code now checks whether the entire `arr1` is present at some index in `arr2`.\n\n**python**",
