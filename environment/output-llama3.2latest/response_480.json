  "explanation": "### Explanation\nThe code provided has an issue with finding the maximum occurring character. The current implementation returns all characters that occur at the maximum frequency, but it should return only one of them. This is because a single character can have the highest frequency if no other characters appear more than once.\n\n### python",
