  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function takes a variable number of tuples as input and returns all elements from these sets. The approach used here is simply to use the built-in `set` data type in Python, which automatically removes any duplicates from a collection. This makes it suitable for converting multiple tuples into a single set.\n\n**python**",
