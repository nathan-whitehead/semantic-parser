  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function removes all odd numbers from a given list of integers. It iterates over each number in the list, checks if it's even or odd, and returns a new list containing only the even numbers. This approach is simple and efficient as it avoids the need for conditional statements or loops.\n\n**python**",
