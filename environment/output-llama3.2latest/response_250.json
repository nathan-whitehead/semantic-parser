  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function is designed to take a tuple and an element as input, and return the number of occurrences of that element in the tuple. It achieves this by using Python's built-in indexing feature to iterate over the elements of the tuple and count the matches. This approach ensures simplicity and efficiency.\n\n**python**",
