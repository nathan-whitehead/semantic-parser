  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code has a logical error where it checks for the existence of an intersection set before checking if the record already exists at that time. This means that even if the record does not exist at a certain time, the function will still return an empty dictionary. To fix this, we need to reorder the iteration over the tuples.\n\nPython",
