  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function uses a dictionary to store the numbers we have seen so far and their counts. It then iterates over the input list, incrementing the count for each number it encounters. If the count becomes greater than 1, it means we've found a duplicate, so we add it to the output list.\n\n**python**",
