  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe given code attempts to solve the problem of determining whether two strings are isomorphic to each other. An isomorphism between two strings means that they have the same length and their characters can be mapped one-to-one from one string to another, such that all characters are used exactly once.\n\nHowever, the provided code has several issues: it's trying to use a custom syntax for defining functions (`python`), and the comparison logic in the if statement is incorrect.\n\nCode\n----",
