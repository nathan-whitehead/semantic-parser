  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe original code attempts to solve the problem by first counting the frequency of each element using a dictionary. It then calculates the total number of combinations and subtracts the number of pairs that should be excluded due to duplicate counts.\n\nHowever, there are two main issues with this approach:\n\n1. The function takes an integer as input (the expected output) but does not handle it correctly.\n2. It uses `math.comb` incorrectly, which is used for counting combinations without repetition.\n\nThe corrected code defines a new function that takes the array and expected output separately, handles them correctly, and uses the correct formula to calculate the number of pairs to exclude due to duplicate counts.\n\nCode\n----",
