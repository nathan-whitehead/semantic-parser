  "explanation": "Explanation\n------------\n\nThe provided code has several issues. It's trying to sort the arrays based on their minimum values, but it's not correctly calculating the range of each array. The pointers for each array are also not being used correctly.\n\nThe function `candidate` should find the smallest range that includes at-least one element from each of the given arrays. It should sort the arrays and initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of each array. Then, it should move these pointers to find a smaller range that covers all elements from each array.\n\nCode\n-----",
