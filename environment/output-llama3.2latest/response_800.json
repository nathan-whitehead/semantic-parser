  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe function takes a string as input and returns the string with all whitespaces removed. The approach used is to iterate over each character in the string, checking if it's a whitespace. If not, the character is added to the result string. This process continues until all characters have been checked.\n\n**python**",
