  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\nThe given code attempts to calculate the minimum total path sum in a triangle by iterating from the second last row towards the first row. However, it has an issue with scoping because the variable `triangle` is reassigned within the function, and this new assignment does not affect the outside scope. \n\nCode\n-----",
