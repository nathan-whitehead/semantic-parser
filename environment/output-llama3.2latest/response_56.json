  "explanation": "Explanation\n----------\n\nThe code attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the number is negative, and then converting it to a string. It reverses the string representation of the number and checks if the original number minus 1 is equal to twice its reverse. However, this approach has issues with handling negative numbers and not correctly calculating the reverse of the number.\n\nCode\n-----",
