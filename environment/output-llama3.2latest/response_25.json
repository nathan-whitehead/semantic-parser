  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code attempts to calculate the product of non-repeated elements by iterating through all input arrays and updating a frequency dictionary. However, the test case passed indicates that the function encountered an issue when trying to iterate over individual numbers in a list. This happens because the 'num_list' variable is not guaranteed to be iterable (i.e., it could be a single number), which leads to the TypeError.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we need to modify the code to correctly handle cases where 'num_list' contains integers instead of lists. We also need to restructure our approach since simply counting frequency won't directly give us the product of non-repeated elements without considering their values.\n\n\n**python**",
