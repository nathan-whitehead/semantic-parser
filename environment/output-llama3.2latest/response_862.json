  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code attempts to find the occurrences of n most common words in a given text. However, there are two main issues: (1) the NLTK library must be installed and imported properly before use, but this import statement is inside the function body where it won't work as expected due to variable scope. Additionally, variable `n` should be checked for its value at the beginning of the function before being used in any operation.\n\nCode\n-----",
