  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe given code uses regular expressions to remove non-alphanumeric characters from the input string. However, it doesn't handle spaces correctly because `\\s` in `re.sub()` matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.), not just space. The issue arises when we have strings like \"python  @#&^%$*program123\" which are supposed to return \"pythonprogram123\". We need to modify the code so that it only removes non-alphanumeric characters without spaces.\n\nPython",
