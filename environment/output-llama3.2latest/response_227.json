  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function will take three numbers as input and return their minimum value. It uses Python's built-in min() function to achieve this, which returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments.\n\nThe approach used here is straightforward: simply pass the three numbers to the min() function, and it will return the smallest one.",
