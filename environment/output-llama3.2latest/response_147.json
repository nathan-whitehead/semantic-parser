  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code has a logical flaw where it passes the triangle and the row index to the `fill_row` function, which is not necessary. The `dp` table needs to be filled with the elements of the input triangle.\n\nTo fix this issue, we will modify the code so that the first row of the `dp` table is initialized directly from the triangle. Then, we fill the rest of the table using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.\n\n\n**python**",
