  "explanation": "# Explanation\nThe provided code attempts to count bidirectional tuple pairs in a list of tuples. However, the current implementation has an incorrect logic and is producing incorrect results due to its inefficiency and lack of optimization.\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use a dictionary to store the frequency of each element and then check for bidirectional pairs within the loop. The main issue with the original code was that it counted all possible pairs (both bidirectional and not), not just those where both elements have a frequency greater than zero. \n\nAdditionally, the function does not handle cases where two different tuples can be represented as the same pair.\n\n# python",
