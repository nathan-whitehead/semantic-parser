  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function calculates the smallest prime divisor of a given number. It uses a simple trial division method to check for divisibility by small prime numbers, starting from 2. If no divisors are found, it returns the number itself as its smallest prime divisor.\n\n**python**",
