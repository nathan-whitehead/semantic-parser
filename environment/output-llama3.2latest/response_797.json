  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function takes two parameters, `l` (lower bound) and `r` (upper bound), which represent the range of natural numbers for which we want to calculate the sum of odd numbers. The approach is to use a simple loop that iterates over each number in the given range, checks if it's an odd number, and adds it to the total sum.\n\n**python**",
