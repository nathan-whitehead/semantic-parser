  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe issue with the code is that it's not correctly handling the function arguments. The original prompt mentioned a list of tuples, but the function was only taking one tuple as input. Additionally, the function was expecting two arguments in the test case, which caused a TypeError.\n\nCode\n----",
