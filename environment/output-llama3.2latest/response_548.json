  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function takes an integer list as input and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence. It uses dynamic programming to build up a table of lengths for each subsequence, then returns the maximum value in this table. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input sequence.\n\n**python**",
