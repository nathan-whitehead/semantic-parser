  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nAn abundant number is a positive integer for which the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) is greater than the number. This function checks if a given number is abundant by iterating through all numbers from 1 to half of the input number, checking if it's a divisor, and adding up the smaller divisor if true.\n\n**python**",
