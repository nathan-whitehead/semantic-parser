  "explanation": "Explanation\n=====================================\n\nThe provided code is attempting to find the maximum length of a common sublist among multiple sublists in the input list. However, it contains several issues that cause the test cases to fail. The main issue is with the line `if j in min_set: current_length += 1; min_set.remove(j)`. This line should be inside a loop that iterates over all elements in the sublist, not just the ones already in the set. Additionally, there's no handling of the case where two sublists have common elements but their lengths are different.\n\nCode\n================",
