  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe issue with the provided code is that it's not correctly removing duplicate words from the input string, as indicated by the error message. The assertion error occurs because the expected output of the function should remove all occurrences of each word, including those that are part of other words.\n\nThe current implementation splits the input string into words, counts their frequency using a Counter, and then creates a list of unique words without counts, sorted in lexicographical order. However, this approach doesn't handle punctuation properly, as it removes words from the count based on leading/trailing spaces.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the code to correctly split each word from punctuation, count their frequency using Counter, and then create a set of unique words without counts, sorted in lexicographical order.\n\n**python**",
