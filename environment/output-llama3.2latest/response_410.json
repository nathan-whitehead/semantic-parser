  "explanation": "Explanation\nThe original code attempts to find the minimum value in a heterogeneous list by initializing `min_val` with the first element of the list. It then iterates over each element, updating `min_val` if it finds a smaller value. However, this approach fails when encountering elements of different data types, as Python's comparison operators don't support mixing integers and strings.\n\nCode",
