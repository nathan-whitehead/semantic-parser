  "explanation": "Explanation\n================\n\nThe provided code attempts to reverse only the vowels of a given string. However, it has several issues, including trying to use the `python` keyword as a variable, which causes a NameError. Additionally, the approach is inefficient and prone to errors.\n\nThe corrected function uses a more straightforward approach by iterating over each character in the string and appending or replacing vowels accordingly.\n\nCode\n------",
