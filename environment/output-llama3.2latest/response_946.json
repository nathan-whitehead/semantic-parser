  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe original code is attempting to find the most common elements and their counts in a specified text. However, it has an error in its logic. The code is splitting the text into individual characters instead of words, which causes it to miss many occurrences of certain letters. Additionally, it's returning all elements with the maximum count, but the task requires finding the most common elements.\n\n**python**",
