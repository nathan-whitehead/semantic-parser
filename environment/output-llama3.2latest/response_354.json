  "explanation": "Explanation\n-----------\n\nThe code is attempting to calculate the nth term of an arithmetic progression using the formula a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d. However, there was an error in indexing. The correct function should return the value at index n-1 instead of just calculating the nth term.\n\nCode\n----",
