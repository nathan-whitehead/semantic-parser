  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThis function takes an IP address as input and returns it without any leading zeroes. The approach is to split the IP address into its four parts, remove any leading zeroes from each part, and then join them back together with dots in between. This ensures that the resulting IP address is still valid.\n\n**python**",
