  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe `candidate` function checks if a given string contains at least one letter and one number. It uses Python's built-in string methods, such as `isalpha()` and `isdigit()`, to achieve this. The approach is simple and efficient, making it suitable for most use cases.\n\n**python**",
