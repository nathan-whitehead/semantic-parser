  "explanation": "**Explanation**\nThe provided Python function uses the modulo operator (%) to find the remainder of the division of the input number by 10. This will give us the last digit of the number, which is then returned as an integer. The approach is simple and efficient, making it suitable for most use cases.\n\n**python**",
