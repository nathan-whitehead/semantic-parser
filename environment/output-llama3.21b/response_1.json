  "explanation": "Explanation:\nThe error occurs because the code is trying to create a list of lists with integers, but it's getting treated as a list of floats due to the line `dp = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m + 1)]`. To fix this, we need to change the type of `cost` from a 2D array of floats to a 2D array of integers.",
